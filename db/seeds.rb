# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

#1 - expensive
#2 - favorite
#3 - game

# Category.create!([
#                 {category_id: 1, product_id: 2},
#                 {category_id: 2, product_id: 3},
#                 {category_id: 3, product_id: 14},
#                 {category_id: 3, product_id: 15},
#                 {category_id: 2, product_id: 1},
#                 {category_id: 1, product_id: 3}
